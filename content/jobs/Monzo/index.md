- As an intern at Monzo, I collaborated within a dynamic team of developers, contributing to the development of enterprise-level microservice applications spanning various financial domains, including online banking, payment processing, investment management, and advanced virtual credit and debit card solutions.

* My role encompassed the design and implementation of highly scalable transactional APIs for payment processing. By leveraging contemporary technologies, I engineered solutions with the capacity to seamlessly process over 1,000 transactions per second. These achievements underscore my commitment to innovation and technical excellence, demonstrating my valuable contributions to the Monzo team.
